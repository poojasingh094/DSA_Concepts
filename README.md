# DSA_Concepts
Let's learn DSA with examples
## Hello Coders!! 

Welcome to this repository! I have included all the important concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) along with examples that are fundamental for getting started with coding.

## AIM:
- To Share Learning: Documenting and sharing the DSA concepts I learn to help others on their coding journey.
- Concise Examples: Providing clear and concise coding examples for better understanding of each concept.
- Organized Topics: Each topic is organized into separate folders with examples to make learning easier and more structured.

These notes are time-saving and efficient. They have been a valuable resource in my coding journey, and I hope these resources help you as much as they have helped me. Happy coding!:D

Let's learn and code together:D

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
These notes are primarily based on the concepts taught by Striver in his DSA Playlist. The explanations and coding examples here are references to what he teaches, organized in a way that works best for my learning style. If you want to learn directly from the source, I highly recommend checking out his videos.
